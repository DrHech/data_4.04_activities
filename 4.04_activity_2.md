# 4.04 Activity 2

Keep using the same dataset.

1. Repeat the same steps already done on the class for the columns `STATE` and `DOMAIN` to find the _chi-square_ statistic.
2. Check the `p` value to decide to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis. If you reject the null hypothesis, then drop one of the columns (`STATE` here).
